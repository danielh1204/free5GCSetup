# Docker images

Dockerfiles in this folder are only used in a separate private Git repo as a resource for automating the building of container images and publishing them to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/towards5gs). We publish them here so that project users have access to these Dockerfiles and can contribute to their development if needed. However, if you want to do a Docker container based deployment, please check other projects for this purpose (e.g. [free5gc-compose](https://github.com/free5gc/free5gc-compose)).
